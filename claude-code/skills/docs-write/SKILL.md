# Documentation Writing Skill

@_shared/style-guides/style-guide.md

## When writing documentation

### Start here

1. **Who is this for?** Match complexity to audience. Don't oversimplify hard things or overcomplicate simple ones.
2. **What do they need?** Get them to the answer fast. Nobody wants to be in docs longer than necessary.
3. **What did you struggle with?** Those common questions you had when learning? Answer them (without literally including the question).

### Writing process

**Draft:**

- Write out the steps/explanation as you'd tell a colleague
- Lead with what to do, then explain why
- Use headings that state your point: "Set SAML before adding users" not "SAML configuration timing"

**Edit:**

- Read aloud. Does it sound like you talking? If it's too formal, simplify.
- Cut anything that doesn't directly help the reader
- Check each paragraph has one clear purpose
- Verify examples actually work (don't give examples that error)

**Polish:**

- Make links descriptive (never "here")
- Backticks only for code/variables, **bold** for UI elements
- American spelling, serial commas
- Keep images minimal and scoped tight

**Format:**

- Run prettier on the file after making edits: `yarn prettier --write <file-path>`
- This ensures consistent formatting across all documentation

## Helper Scripts

The following scripts in `scripts/` provide automated formatting:

| Script | Purpose | CLI Example |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `prettier_wrapper.py` | Format markdown files consistently | `python3 scripts/prettier_wrapper.py docs/` |

### Usage

```bash
# Format a single file
python3 scripts/prettier_wrapper.py README.md

# Format all markdown in a directory
python3 scripts/prettier_wrapper.py --write docs/

# Check formatting without modifying (for CI)
python3 scripts/prettier_wrapper.py --check docs/

# Use custom config
python3 scripts/prettier_wrapper.py --config .prettierrc docs/
```

---

### Common patterns

**Instructions:**

```markdown
Run:
\`\`\`
command-to-run
\`\`\`

Then:
\`\`\`
next-command
\`\`\`

This ensures you're getting the latest changes.
```

Not: "(remember to run X before Y...)" buried in a paragraph.

**Headings:**

- "Use environment variables for configuration" [OK]
- "Environment variables" [ERROR] (too vague)
- "How to use environment variables for configuration" [ERROR] (too wordy)

**Links:**

- "Check out the [SAML documentation](link)" [OK]
- "Read the docs [here](link)" [ERROR]

### Watch out for

- Describing tasks as "easy" (you don't know the reader's context)
- Using "we" when talking about product features (use the product name or "it")
- Formal language: "utilize", "reference", "offerings"
- Too peppy: multiple exclamation points
- Burying the action in explanation
- Code examples that don't work
- Numbers that will become outdated

### Quick reference
