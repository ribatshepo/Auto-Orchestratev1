# Agent Activation Protocol

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Status**: Active

---

## Purpose

The Agent Activation Protocol enables the orchestrator to conditionally spawn domain-expert agents (qa-engineer, security-engineer, sre, infra-engineer, data-engineer, ml-engineer) for single-stage review participation during autonomous pipeline execution. Without this protocol, these 6 agents are confined to manual domain commands (`/qa`, `/security`, `/infra`, `/data-ml-ops`) and are never invoked by the Big Three autonomous loops — even when processes P-032 to P-057 require their expertise.

This protocol is **complementary** to the Command Dispatch Protocol. Command dispatch invokes domain guide **Skills** (Tier 2, inline text analysis) via the loop controller. Agent activation spawns domain **agents** (subagents with tool access) via the orchestrator. Dispatch provides high-level findings; activation provides detailed, code-level review.

```

```

## Constraints

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| AGENT-ACTIVATE-001 | **Stage-transition evaluation** — The orchestrator evaluates domain-activation rules at each stage transition. If a domain agent's trigger condition is met, that agent is spawned for the current stage only. The agent produces a review artifact and exits. |
| AGENT-ACTIVATE-002 | **Single-stage participation** — Domain agents activated conditionally do NOT persist across stages. They are single-stage participants, not permanent pipeline members. Each activation is scoped to one stage's artifacts. |
| AGENT-ACTIVATE-003 | **Budget-exempt spawns** — Domain agent spawns do NOT decrement `REMAINING_BUDGET`. They are exempt from budget accounting, following the same exemption pattern as Stages 5 and 6. This ensures domain reviews never crowd out core pipeline work. |
| AGENT-ACTIVATE-004 | **Review-only output** — Domain agents produce review artifacts (findings, recommendations, severity counts). They do NOT produce `proposed-tasks.json` entries, do NOT modify `PROPOSED_ACTIONS`, and do NOT create tasks. Their output is advisory input for subsequent stages. |
| AGENT-ACTIVATE-005 | **Activation cap** — Maximum 2 domain agent activations per orchestrator spawn. This prevents runaway activation when multiple conditions match simultaneously. If more than 2 rules match, prioritize by severity (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM) then by rule ID (lower first). |

---

## Stage 0 (Research) — Design Decision

**No domain agents activate at Stage 0 by design.** The activation rules table above intentionally has no entries for `trigger_stage: 0`. This reflects three architectural choices:

1. **Stage 0 is researcher-led.** The researcher agent consults all relevant domains (security threat surface, infrastructure constraints, data/ML considerations, accessibility, performance) as part of its evidence-gathering pass. Spawning domain agents at Stage 0 would duplicate the researcher's job and produce noisy parallel reviews.

2. **Domain expertise enters at Stage 2 (specification) and beyond.** Once the researcher has produced findings, the domain agents activate at Stage 2/3/5 to translate research into implementation requirements (e.g., security-engineer at Stage 2 incorporates threat-model findings into spec security requirements).

3. **Process injection at Stage 0** (see `processes/process_injection_map.md`) covers the canonical processes that engage during research (P-001 Intent Articulation, P-038 Threat Modeling for COMPLEX scope, P-074 RAID Log seeding for COMPLEX). These are advisory injections — the researcher acknowledges them in its output, the agents themselves don't spawn.

**Consequence**: an auditor or contributor reading this protocol should NOT add Stage 0 activation rules for domain agents without first considering whether the work belongs in (a) the researcher's prompt + research depth tier, (b) the process injection map's Stage 0 hooks, or (c) a later stage's activation rule.

If a future use case genuinely requires a domain agent at Stage 0 (e.g., a regulated industry where security pre-clearance must precede research), add the rule here AND update the researcher agent's prompt to expect the parallel review.

## Condition Detection Methods

The orchestrator evaluates activation conditions by reading stage artifacts with Glob/Grep (tools it already has). No new tools are required.

| Condition Type | Detection Method |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Spec keyword match** (ACT-001 to ACT-004) | Grep Stage 2 spec output (`.orchestrate/<SESSION_ID>/stage-2/*.md`) for domain-specific keywords. Match against section headings and content body — not filenames alone. |
| **Process acknowledgment check** (ACT-002, ACT-005, ACT-010, ACT-011) | Read `stage-receipt.json` for the completed stage. Check `process_acknowledgments` array for matching process IDs with `severity` of HIGH or CRITICAL. |
| **Dispatch receipt check** (ACT-005) | Glob `.orchestrate/<SESSION_ID>/dispatch-receipts/dispatch-*-TRIG-001-*.json` for `/security` dispatch receipts. Presence of any receipt triggers the rule. |
| **Task context match** (ACT-006) | Check current task's `description` and `dispatch_hint` fields for domain keywords. |
| **Artifact presence check** (ACT-007 to ACT-009) | Glob session directory and project root for domain-specific files: `Dockerfile`, `*.tf`, `*.yaml` (k8s manifests), `*.ipynb`, model files, etc. |
| **Session history check** (ACT-009) | Check `checkpoint.stages_completed` and stage artifacts for IaC file creation/modification records. |
| **Frontend artifact check** (ACT-012) | Glob session directory and project root for UI component files: `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `*.html`, React/Vue/Svelte component directories. Match component creation/modification in stage artifacts. |

**False positive mitigation**: Conditions should match keywords in **context-relevant sections** of artifacts, not in passing references. For example, a spec mentioning "Docker" in a "Deployment" section triggers ACT-003, but "Docker" in a "Background" section describing prior work does not. When in doubt, activate — a focused 10-turn review has minimal overhead and false negatives (missing a needed review) are worse than false positives.

## Evaluation Function

```
FUNCTION evaluate_agent_activation(completed_stage, stage_receipt, dispatch_receipts, task_context):

  INPUT:
    completed_stage:    numeric stage just completed (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5)
    stage_receipt:      parsed stage-receipt.json for the completed stage (if exists)
    dispatch_receipts:  array of dispatch receipts from session dispatch-receipts/ directory
    task_context:       current task descriptions, dispatch_hints, and session scope

  activations = []
  activation_candidates = []

  # Step 1: Find rules whose trigger_stage matches the NEXT stage
  next_stage = completed_stage + 1  # simplified; handle 4 → 4.5 → 5 mapping
  
  FOR EACH rule IN ACTIVATION_RULES_TABLE:
    IF rule.trigger_stage != next_stage:
      SKIP

    # Step 2: Evaluate condition
    condition_met = evaluate_activation_condition(rule, stage_receipt, dispatch_receipts, task_context)

    IF condition_met:
      severity = determine_severity(rule, stage_receipt, dispatch_receipts)
      activation_candidates.append({rule, severity})

  # Step 3: Sort by severity (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM), then rule_id (lower first)
  activation_candidates.sort(key=lambda c: (severity_rank(c.severity), c.rule.rule_id))

  # Step 4: Cap at 2 activations (AGENT-ACTIVATE-005)
  activations = activation_candidates[:2]

  # Step 5: Deduplicate by agent — if two rules activate the same agent, keep highest severity
  seen_agents = set()
  deduplicated = []
  FOR EACH activation IN activations:
    IF activation.rule.agent NOT IN seen_agents:
      deduplicated.append(activation)
      seen_agents.add(activation.rule.agent)
  activations = deduplicated

  RETURN activations

## Integration with Orchestrator Execution Loop

The orchestrator integrates agent activation at two points in its execution loop:

### Point 1: Post-Stage Activation Evaluation

After all tasks for a stage complete and before processing the next stage's tasks:

```
# After line ~317 in orchestrator.md (after task completion loop, before Post-Loop Mandatory Gates)

completed_stage = get_highest_completed_stage(all_tasks)

IF stage_just_completed(completed_stage):  # First time seeing this stage fully done
    # Read activation rules from manifest (MANIFEST-001)
    activation_rules = manifest.agents[*].activation_rules WHERE trigger_stage == completed_stage + 1
    
    stage_receipt = read(".orchestrate/<SESSION_ID>/stage-<completed_stage>/stage-receipt.json")
    dispatch_receipts = glob(".orchestrate/<SESSION_ID>/dispatch-receipts/dispatch-*.json")
    
    activations = evaluate_agent_activation(completed_stage, stage_receipt, dispatch_receipts, task_context)
    
    domain_agents_spawned = 0
    FOR EACH activation IN activations:
        IF domain_agents_spawned >= 2: BREAK  # AGENT-ACTIVATE-005
        
        output(f"[DOMAIN-REVIEW] {activation.rule_id}: Spawning {activation.agent} for Stage {completed_stage + 1} review")
        
        spawn_subagent(
            activation.agent,
            review_task={
                subject: f"Domain review: {activation.review_scope}",
                description: activation.review_scope,
                stage: completed_stage + 1,
                output_path: f".orchestrate/{SESSION_ID}/domain-reviews/{activation.agent}-stage-{completed_stage + 1}.md"
            },
            extra_prompt = COMMON_REVIEW_BLOCK + AGENT_SPECIFIC_TEMPLATE,
            max_turns = 10
        )
        # NOTE: Does NOT decrement REMAINING_BUDGET (AGENT-ACTIVATE-003)
        
        output(f"[DOMAIN-REVIEW] {activation.agent} review complete. Artifact: {output_path}")
        domain_agents_spawned += 1
```

### Point 2: Review Context Injection into Stage Spawns

Before spawning agents for the next stage's tasks, inject domain review findings:

```
# Before spawn_subagent() call in execution loop (~line 302 in orchestrator.md)

domain_reviews = glob(".orchestrate/<SESSION_ID>/domain-reviews/*-stage-{task.stage}.md")
IF domain_reviews:
    review_summary = compile_reviews(domain_reviews)
    extra_prompt += f"""

## Domain Expert Review Findings

The following domain experts reviewed artifacts relevant to this stage. Address their findings:

{review_summary}

CRITICAL findings MUST be addressed in your implementation.
HIGH findings SHOULD be addressed in your implementation.
MEDIUM/LOW findings: acknowledge in your output but no action required.
"""
```

---

## Relationship to Other Protocols

| Protocol | Relationship |
|----------|-------------|
| **Command Dispatch** (`command-dispatch.md`) | Complementary. Dispatch invokes Skills for high-level analysis; activation spawns agents for code-level review. A dispatch receipt can trigger an activation rule (ACT-005). |
| **Process Injection Map** (`process_injection_map.md`) | Additive. Process injection maps processes to stages (advisory/gate). Activation adds expert review when those processes flag issues. |
| **Cross-Pipeline State** (`cross-pipeline-state.md`) | Domain review artifacts are session-local. Findings that warrant cross-pipeline persistence should be written to `.orchestrate/pipeline-state/codebase-analysis.jsonl` by the orchestrator. |
| **Escalation Protocol** | Orthogonal. Escalation handles command-to-command transitions (auto-debug → auto-orchestrate). Activation handles within-orchestrator domain reviews. |

---

## Checkpoint Schema Additions

The auto-orchestrate checkpoint gains these fields (added in schema 1.3.0):

```json
{
  "domain_activations": [],
  "domain_reviews": {
    "0": [], "1": [], "2": [], "3": [], "4": [], "4.5": [], "5": [], "6": []
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `domain_activations` | array | `[]` | Append-only log of all domain agent activations. Each entry: `{ rule_id, agent, stage, timestamp, artifact_path, findings_count, severity_max }` |
| `domain_reviews` | object | `{}` per stage | Per-stage array of agent names that produced reviews. Used to inject review context into spawn prompts. |
