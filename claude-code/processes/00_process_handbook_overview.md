## Executive Summary

This handbook consolidates 93 formally specified engineering processes across 17 categories into a single, navigable reference. Every process in this handbook is derived from two foundational documents:

1. **The Clarity of Intent Framework** — A 4-stage process (Intent Frame, Scope Contract, Dependency Map, Sprint Bridge) that translates project vision into aligned, executable work. Each stage produces a specific artifact and enforces a gate review before the next stage begins.

2. **The Engineering Team Structure Guide** — A comprehensive organizational model defining 13 agent roles across 7 reporting layers (Board/CEO through IC), operating in a hybrid hierarchical + squad model.

The process framework covers the full lifecycle of engineering work: from strategic intent articulation through scope definition, dependency management, sprint execution, quality assurance, security compliance, infrastructure provisioning, data/ML operations, site reliability, documentation, organizational audit, post-delivery measurement, risk management, communication, capacity planning, technical excellence standards, and onboarding.

### How It Derives from the Clarity of Intent Framework

The Clarity of Intent framework provides the backbone for project delivery:

- **Stage 1 (Intent Frame)** produces the Intent Brief and is governed by Category 1 processes (P-001 through P-006)
- **Stage 2 (Scope Contract)** produces the Scope Contract and is governed by Category 2 processes (P-007 through P-014)
- **Stage 3 (Dependency Map)** produces the Dependency Charter and is governed by Category 3 processes (P-015 through P-021)
- **Stage 4 (Sprint Bridge)** produces the Sprint Kickoff Brief and is governed by Category 4 processes (P-022 through P-031)

The remaining 13 categories (5 through 17) provide the supporting infrastructure, governance, and operational processes that make the core delivery pipeline reliable and sustainable.

## Cross-Process Dependency Summary

### Core Delivery Critical Path

The minimum sequence of processes from project initiation to post-launch measurement:

```
P-001 --> P-002 + P-003 --> P-004 --> P-007 --> P-008 + P-009 + P-011 + P-012
  --> P-013 --> P-015 --> P-016 + P-017 + P-018 --> P-019 --> P-022 --> P-023 + P-024
  --> P-025 --> P-026 + P-031 --> P-034 --> P-036 --> P-027 --> P-048 --> P-073
```

**Elapsed time for critical path**: 8-15 working days from intent to Sprint 1 readiness (consistent with the Clarity of Intent 8-12 day target).

### Process Execution Programs

Processes are organized into 18 execution programs based on dependency ordering:

### Key Cross-Category Dependencies

| From Process | To Process | Nature |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| P-004 (Cat 1) | P-007+ (Cat 2) | Intent Brief must be locked before Scope Contract begins |
| P-013 (Cat 2) | P-015 (Cat 3) | Scope Contract must be locked before Dependency Mapping |
| P-019 (Cat 3) | P-022 (Cat 4) | Dependencies accepted before Sprint Bridge |
| P-007 (Cat 2) | P-032 (Cat 5) | Deliverables defined before Test Architecture |
| P-012 (Cat 2) | P-038 (Cat 6) | AppSec Scope Review enables Threat Modeling |
| P-033 (Cat 5) | P-039 (Cat 6) | Test framework required for SAST/DAST integration |
| P-054 (Cat 9) | P-035 (Cat 5) | SLO definitions required for Performance Testing thresholds |
| P-054 (Cat 9) | P-055 (Cat 9) | SLOs define incident severity thresholds |
| P-031 (Cat 4) | P-058 (Cat 10) | Feature development produces API changes needing documentation |
| P-048 (Cat 7) | P-059 (Cat 10) | Runbooks required before production release |
| P-048 (Cat 7) | P-061 (Cat 10) | Release triggers release notes |
| P-082 (Cat 15) | P-005 (Cat 1) | Capacity data required for strategic prioritization |
| P-005 (Cat 1) | P-078 (Cat 14) | Strategic priorities feed OKR cascade |
| P-013 (Cat 2) | P-073 (Cat 12) | Scope Contract defines success metrics to measure post-launch |
| P-074 (Cat 13) | P-065 (Cat 11) | RAID Log reviewed in Director audit |
| P-069 (Cat 11) | P-074 (Cat 13) | Audit findings tracked in RAID Log |

### Four Formal Gates

| Gate | Process ID | Stage | Chaired By | Key Pass Criteria |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Intent Review | P-004 | Stage 1 | Engineering Director | All 5 questions answered; measurable outcome; OKR reference; boundary stated |
| Scope Lock | P-013 | Stage 2 | PM | Every deliverable owned; DoD written; exclusions acknowledged; metrics trace to intent |
| Dependency Acceptance | P-019 | Stage 3 | TPM | Every dependency owner committed; critical path documented; escalation paths defined |
| Sprint Readiness | P-025 | Stage 4 | EM | Sprint goal connected; intent trace visible; stories have criteria; engineers can explain what/why/done |

## How to Use This Handbook

### For Engineering Managers (EMs)

1. Start with the **Core Delivery Pipeline** (Categories 1-4) for any new project
2. Use Category 11 (**Organizational Audit**) to understand your weekly audit responsibilities (P-066)
3. Reference Category 15 (**Capacity & Resource Management**) for quarterly planning
4. Check Category 12 (**Post-Delivery**) for retrospective and measurement processes

### For Product Managers (PMs)

1. Begin every project with P-001 (**Intent Articulation**) and follow through P-004 (**Intent Review Gate**)
2. Own the Scope Contract processes in Category 2 (P-007 through P-014)
3. Use P-024 (**Story Writing**) and P-029 (**Backlog Refinement**) for sprint preparation
4. Measure outcomes with P-073 (**Post-Launch Outcome Measurement**)

### For Technical Program Managers (TPMs)

1. Own Category 3 (**Dependency & Coordination**) end-to-end
2. Maintain the RAID Log (P-074) throughout the project
3. Run dependency standups (P-020) and escalate blockers (P-021)
4. Manage production releases (P-048) and pre-launch CAB reviews (P-076)

### For Tech Leads and Staff Engineers

1. Participate in Scope Contract authoring (P-007, P-008) and gate reviews
2. Own technical audit layer (P-067) — review every PR and ADR
3. Use Category 16 (**Technical Excellence**) for RFCs (P-085), tech debt tracking (P-086), and standards
4. Publish Architecture Decision Records per P-060

### For Security Engineers

1. Engage early via P-012 (**AppSec Scope Review**) at Stage 2
2. Run threat models (P-038) in Sprint 1
3. Monitor SAST/DAST (P-039), triage CVEs (P-040), manage exceptions (P-041)
4. Train Security Champions quarterly (P-043)

### For SREs

1. Define SLOs for every service (P-054) before production deployment
2. Own incident response (P-055) and post-mortems (P-056)
3. Author runbooks (P-059) and manage on-call rotations (P-057)

### Navigating the Documents

- **This file** (`00_process_handbook_overview.md`): Start here for orientation, the master process table, and the agent responsibility matrix
- **Category files** (`01_` through `17_`): Full process specifications for each category
- **Cross-reference index** (`18_cross_reference_index.md`): Process-to-agent mappings, process-to-stage mappings, dependency graph, gate/checkpoint master list

### Process ID Convention

All processes use the format **P-NNN** where NNN is a zero-padded three-digit number from 001 to 093. Cross-references between processes always use this ID format.
