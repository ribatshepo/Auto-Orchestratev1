# Agent-to-Process Responsibility Map

**Version**: 1.1 | **Date**: 2026-04-25

This document lists every process each of the 12 team agents owns (primary responsibility) and supports. Use this to quickly see the full scope of process responsibilities for any agent role.

> **Consolidation note (2026-04-06)**: The original 13-agent roster included `cloud-engineer` and `platform-engineer` as separate agents. Both were consolidated into `infra-engineer` (see Section 8 below). The pipeline agent inventory is therefore 12 team agents + 5 meta agents (orchestrator, researcher, session-manager, auditor, debugger). The 5 meta agents do not own any P-XXX process — they implement pipeline orchestration, not organizational process work.

For the full process table with descriptions, see [`00_process_handbook_overview.md`](00_process_handbook_overview.md). For the responsibility matrix showing agent-to-category relationships, see the Agent Responsibility Matrix in the same file.
