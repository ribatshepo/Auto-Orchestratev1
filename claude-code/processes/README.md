## What This Directory Contains

This directory is the **Engineering Processes Handbook** — a comprehensive reference of 93 formally specified engineering processes organized across 17 categories and mapped to 12 team agent roles (22 agents total in the framework, including pipeline-specific orchestrator/researcher/debugger/auditor/session-manager/continuity-scout and the 4 source-category continuity scouts scout-jsonl/scout-sessions/scout-pipeline/scout-context added by CONT-007). It covers the full lifecycle of engineering work: from strategic intent articulation through delivery execution, quality assurance, security compliance, infrastructure, operations, and post-delivery measurement.

Every process in this handbook is derived from two foundational documents:

1. **[The Clarity of Intent Framework](../clarity_of_intent.md)** — A 4-stage process (Intent Frame, Scope Contract, Dependency Map, Sprint Bridge) that translates project vision into aligned, executable work. Each stage produces a specific artifact and enforces a gate review before the next stage begins.

2. **The Engineering Team Structure Guide** — An organizational model defining 13 agent roles across 7 reporting layers (Board/CEO through IC), operating in a hybrid hierarchical + squad model.

The Clarity of Intent framework provides the backbone for project delivery. Its four stages map directly to the first four process categories:

| Clarity of Intent Stage | Artifact Produced | Process Category | Gate Process |
|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Stage 1: Intent Frame | Intent Brief | Category 1 (P-001 to P-006) | P-004: Intent Review Gate |
| Stage 2: Scope Contract | Scope Contract | Category 2 (P-007 to P-014) | P-013: Scope Lock Gate |
| Stage 3: Dependency Map | Dependency Charter | Category 3 (P-015 to P-021) | P-019: Dependency Acceptance Gate |
| Stage 4: Sprint Bridge | Sprint Kickoff Brief | Category 4 (P-022 to P-031) | P-025: Sprint Readiness Gate |

The remaining 13 categories (5 through 17) provide the supporting infrastructure, governance, and operational processes that make the core delivery pipeline reliable and sustainable.

## Quick Navigation by Project Phase

### Starting a new project?

Follow the core delivery pipeline in order:

1. **Category 1** ([`01_intent_strategic_alignment.md`](01_intent_strategic_alignment.md)) — Articulate intent, align to OKRs, define boundaries, pass Intent Review Gate
2. **Category 2** ([`02_scope_contract_management.md`](02_scope_contract_management.md)) — Decompose deliverables, define DoD and metrics, register assumptions/risks, pass Scope Lock Gate
3. **Category 3** ([`03_dependency_coordination.md`](03_dependency_coordination.md)) — Map dependencies, analyze critical path, resolve resource conflicts, pass Dependency Acceptance Gate
4. **Category 4** ([`04_sprint_delivery_execution.md`](04_sprint_delivery_execution.md)) — Author sprint goals, write stories, pass Sprint Readiness Gate, begin execution

Also engage early:
- **Category 6** ([`06_security_compliance.md`](06_security_compliance.md)) — AppSec scope review at Stage 2; threat modeling in Sprint 1
- **Category 13** ([`13_risk_change_management.md`](13_risk_change_management.md)) — Risk register at Scope Lock (P-075); RAID log from Stage 2 onward

### In active development?

During sprints, these categories are continuously active:

- **Category 4** ([`04_sprint_delivery_execution.md`](04_sprint_delivery_execution.md)) — Daily standups, feature development, sprint review/retro, backlog refinement
- **Category 5** ([`05_quality_assurance_testing.md`](05_quality_assurance_testing.md)) — DoD enforcement per story, acceptance verification, contract testing per PR
- **Category 6** ([`06_security_compliance.md`](06_security_compliance.md)) — SAST/DAST on every PR, CVE triage on dependency updates
- **Category 10** ([`10_documentation_knowledge.md`](10_documentation_knowledge.md)) — API docs per API-changing story, ADRs per significant technical decision

> **Parallel sprint execution (PARALLEL-001/002/003)**: When the product-manager (Stage 1) emits `independence_groups` in `proposed-tasks.json`, multiple stories from different groups may be implemented concurrently — up to 5 (configurable to 7) software-engineers run in parallel at Stage 3. Per-process owner mapping is unchanged; what changes is wall-clock time for sprints with mutually-independent stories.

### Preparing for release?

- **Category 5** ([`05_quality_assurance_testing.md`](05_quality_assurance_testing.md)) — Performance testing (P-035) pre-release
- **Category 7** ([`07_infrastructure_platform.md`](07_infrastructure_platform.md)) — Production release management (P-048), golden path and infrastructure provisioning
- **Category 10** ([`10_documentation_knowledge.md`](10_documentation_knowledge.md)) — Runbooks (P-059) required before production release; release notes (P-061) triggered by release
- **Category 13** ([`13_risk_change_management.md`](13_risk_change_management.md)) — Pre-launch CAB review (P-076) for HIGH-risk changes

### After launch?

- **Category 9** ([`09_sre_operations.md`](09_sre_operations.md)) — SLOs active, incident response begins, on-call rotation
- **Category 12** ([`12_post_delivery_retrospective.md`](12_post_delivery_retrospective.md)) — Post-launch outcome measurement at 30/60/90 days (P-073), project post-mortem (P-070), OKR retrospective (P-072)

### Running the organization (continuous)?

- **Category 11** ([`11_organizational_audit.md`](11_organizational_audit.md)) — Audit processes at each organizational layer, per their cadence
- **Category 14** ([`14_communication_alignment.md`](14_communication_alignment.md)) — OKR cascade, stakeholder updates, guild standards, DORA metrics
- **Category 15** ([`15_capacity_resource_management.md`](15_capacity_resource_management.md)) — Quarterly capacity planning, shared resource allocation, succession planning
- **Category 16** ([`16_technical_excellence_standards.md`](16_technical_excellence_standards.md)) — RFCs, tech debt tracking, language tier policy, architecture patterns, developer experience surveys
- **Category 17** ([`17_onboarding_knowledge_transfer.md`](17_onboarding_knowledge_transfer.md)) — New engineer and project onboarding, knowledge transfer
