# Permission Mode Compatibility Matrix (GAP-MED-002)

## Overview

Claude Code operates in different permission modes that affect tool availability and agent behavior. This document provides a compatibility matrix for all **22 agents** (1 pipeline-core + 5 pipeline + 4 continuity scouts under CONT-007 + 12 team) and **49 skills** across permission modes.

**Gap Status**: GAP-MED-002 MEDIUM
**Created**: 2026-02-11 (Iteration 2 remediation)
**Last updated**: 2026-05-16 — synced with autonomous reasoning gates (REASONING-GATE-001), baked-in engineering standards, artifact envelope, parallel stage behavior matrix, and the v1.1 triage routing redesign (planning P1–P4 mandatory for all tiers; `--skip-planning` is the only flag-based bypass).
**Purpose**: Document agent/skill behavior across permission modes to enable fully autonomous operation

## Permission Modes

### Mode 1: Plan Mode

**Characteristics**:
- Interactive planning and approval workflow
- User reviews proposed actions before execution
- `EnterPlanMode` tool available
- Step-by-step execution with user confirmation
- Autonomous reasoning gates (`REASONING-GATE-001`) still fire — the `meta-reasoner` skill is read-only (`Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` only) and runs regardless of permission tier; gate-approval JSON is written by the orchestrator agent under the same approval rules as other writes in this mode.

**Tool Behavior**:
- Read: Available
- Write/Edit: Requires approval for each operation
- Bash: Requires approval for each command
- Task: Availability depends on context

**Typical Use Cases**:
- Exploratory work with uncertain outcomes
- High-risk operations requiring oversight
- Learning new codebases
- User wants to review each change

### Mode 2: Auto-Accept Mode

**Characteristics**:
- Tools execute without per-action approval
- User grants blanket permission at session start
- Fast iteration on trusted operations
- Suitable for autonomous workflows

**Tool Behavior**:
- Read: Available, no approval needed
- Write/Edit: Available, no approval needed
- Bash: Available, no approval needed
- Task: Availability depends on spawn context

**Typical Use Cases**:
- `/auto-orchestrate` command
- Trusted refactoring operations
- Batch file updates
- CI/CD automation

### Mode 3: Manual Approval Mode

**Characteristics**:
- Default mode for most conversations
- Per-action approval for write operations
- Read operations allowed without approval
- Balance between control and efficiency

**Tool Behavior**:
- Read: Available, no approval needed
- Write/Edit: Requires user confirmation
- Bash: May require approval for destructive commands
- Task: Availability depends on context

**Typical Use Cases**:
- Interactive development sessions
- Code review with modifications
- Experimental changes
- Reviewing agent-generated plans

## Agent Compatibility Matrix

| Agent | Plan Mode | Auto-Accept | Manual Approval | Degradation Behavior |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **orchestrator** | Partial | YES (preferred) | Limited | Proposes work via PROPOSED_ACTIONS when Task unavailable (GAP-CRIT-001) — NEVER performs inline execution (MAIN-001, MAIN-002) |
| **product-manager** | Partial | YES | YES | Creates task plans as JSON files if TaskCreate unavailable |
| **software-engineer** | NO (conflicts with IMPL-002) | YES (required) | Partial | Requires Write/Edit access; will fail without auto-accept. Multiple instances may run concurrently at Stage 3 per PARALLEL-002/003 (SE-009) — each inherits the parent's permission mode |
| **technical-writer** | Partial | YES | YES | Can operate with approval for each Write/Edit |
| **session-manager** | Partial | YES (preferred) | YES | Session file writes need approval in manual mode |
| **researcher** | YES | YES | YES | Read-only (WebSearch/WebFetch); fully compatible with all modes |
| **debugger** | NO (conflicts with DBG-002/DBG-004) | YES (required) | Partial | Requires Write/Edit to apply fixes; plan mode conflicts with "fix immediately" constraint |
| **auditor** | YES | YES | YES | Read-only — AUD-001 prohibits all writes; always compatible |
| **engineering-manager** | YES | YES | YES | Read-mostly (planning artefacts); ack/handover writes need approval in manual mode |
| **technical-program-manager** | YES | YES | YES | Read-mostly; RAID-log writes need approval in manual mode |
| **staff-principal-engineer** | YES | YES | YES | Advisory; ADR/RFC writes need approval in manual mode |
| **security-engineer** | YES | YES | YES | Read-only review (analysis only — no auto-fix); fully compatible |
| **qa-engineer** | YES | YES | YES | Mixed: spec analysis read-only; test creation needs Write |
| **infra-engineer** | NO | YES (required) | Partial | Provisions cloud resources; needs Bash + Write |
| **sre** | YES | YES | YES | Read-mostly (incident analysis); runbook writes need approval |
| **data-engineer** | NO | YES (required) | Partial | dbt model + ETL pipeline creation needs Write |
| **ml-engineer** | NO | YES (required) | Partial | Pipeline / model serving config needs Write |

> **Parallel Stage 3 spawns (PARALLEL-001/002/003)**: When the orchestrator spawns N concurrent `software-engineer` instances at Stage 3 (one per independence group, up to `checkpoint.parallel_cap` = 5 default), each spawn inherits the **parent session's permission mode** — there is no per-spawn mode escalation. If the session is in Manual Approval, every parallel software-engineer's Write/Edit will request approval independently. **Recommendation**: when running `/auto-orchestrate` with parallelism enabled, use Auto-Accept; otherwise the gate gain from concurrency is lost to per-spawn approval prompts.

> **Manifest digest impact (MANIFEST-DIGEST-001)**: When `checkpoint.optimizations.manifest_digest` is on (default), most subagents receive a 2.6k slim digest of `manifest.json` instead of the full file. This does not change permission behaviour — agents still see the same `dispatch_triggers`. Only `orchestrator` and `session-manager` receive the full manifest by default; other agents that need full chaining metadata can set `needs_full_manifest: true` on their spawn.

> **Token-optimization flags are permission-neutral**: the `checkpoint.optimizations.*` flags (including `protocol_pack_slim`, `continuity_brief_tiered`, and `artifact_excerpt`) change only *what content* a spawn loads (a slim protocol pack, a scoped continuity slice, an artifact excerpt vs. the full body) — never an agent's **tool grants**. An agent's permitted tools are fixed by its manifest/`.md` `tools` field regardless of which optimizations are active. Two notes: code-producing agents still receive the full `engineering-standards.md` at Stage 3 even under `protocol_pack_slim`; and digest-by-default reading (CONTEXT-DIET-001) only changes default read volume — the full artifact is always readable on demand with the same permissions. See ARCHITECTURE.md §15.

### orchestrator

**Preferred Mode**: Auto-Accept
**Constraints**: MAIN-002 requires Task tool for delegation

**Behavior by Mode**:
- **Plan Mode**: Cannot use EnterPlanMode (conflicts with autonomous operation). If Task available: delegates normally. If Task unavailable: proposes work via PROPOSED_ACTIONS — auto-orchestrate handles delegation on next iteration
- **Auto-Accept**: Full functionality IF Task tool available. Delegates to subagents without interruption
- **Manual Approval**: Limited — each subagent spawn would require approval, breaking autonomous flow

**Known Issues**:
- GAP-CRIT-001: Task tool may be unavailable regardless of permission mode
- Fallback: Proposes work via PROPOSED_ACTIONS for auto-orchestrate to delegate — orchestrator NEVER performs inline execution (MAIN-001, MAIN-002 are non-negotiable regardless of tool availability)

### product-manager

**Preferred Mode**: Auto-Accept or Manual Approval
**Constraints**: None (creates tasks, doesn't write code)

**Behavior by Mode**:
- **Plan Mode**: Can create decomposition plans as markdown files for review
- **Auto-Accept**: Full functionality — creates tasks via TaskCreate, writes plan docs
- **Manual Approval**: Works well — user reviews each task before creation

**Known Issues**: None

### software-engineer

**Preferred Mode**: Auto-Accept (REQUIRED)
**Constraints**: IMPL-002 (Don't ask — make decisions autonomously)

**Behavior by Mode**:
- **Plan Mode**: INCOMPATIBLE — software-engineer makes autonomous decisions (IMPL-002), plan mode requires approval
- **Auto-Accept**: Full functionality — implements, reviews, fixes in one pass
- **Manual Approval**: DEGRADED — approval requests conflict with IMPL-002 constraint. Partial compatibility: user must approve each file write

**Known Issues**:
- Plan mode fundamentally conflicts with software-engineer's "don't ask" constraint
- Recommend: Use `/auto-orchestrate` or manually grant auto-accept when invoking software-engineer

### technical-writer

**Preferred Mode**: Auto-Accept or Manual Approval
**Constraints**: None (documentation updates are low-risk)

**Behavior by Mode**:
- **Plan Mode**: Can search docs (docs-lookup) and propose updates for review
- **Auto-Accept**: Full functionality — updates docs autonomously via docs-write
- **Manual Approval**: Works well — user reviews each doc change via Write/Edit approvals

**Known Issues**: None

### session-manager

**Preferred Mode**: Auto-Accept
**Constraints**: Needs write access to `.orchestrate/<session-id>/` (project-local primary path) and `~/.claude/manifest.json`. Legacy `~/.claude/sessions/` is a read-only fallback for crash recovery of pre-migration sessions only.

**Behavior by Mode**:
- **Plan Mode**: Session management doesn't fit plan-review workflow
- **Auto-Accept**: Full functionality — writes checkpoints, rotates manifest
- **Manual Approval**: Partial — user must approve each session file write (interrupts boot sequence)

**Known Issues**: Boot infrastructure (Step 0) may stall in manual mode awaiting session file write approval

### researcher

**Preferred Mode**: Any (fully compatible with all modes)
**Constraints**: Read-only — uses WebSearch and WebFetch; no file writes

**Behavior by Mode**:
- **Plan Mode**: Full functionality — research is read-only
- **Auto-Accept**: Full functionality
- **Manual Approval**: Full functionality — no write operations to approve

**Known Issues**: None

### debugger

**Preferred Mode**: Auto-Accept (REQUIRED)
**Constraints**: DBG-002 (minimal blast radius), DBG-004 (fix immediately) require Write/Edit access

**Behavior by Mode**:
- **Plan Mode**: INCOMPATIBLE — debugger applies targeted fixes immediately (DBG-004); plan mode approval conflicts with fix-immediately constraint
- **Auto-Accept**: Full functionality — diagnoses errors, applies fixes, verifies, writes debug reports
- **Manual Approval**: DEGRADED — each fix requires Write/Edit approval, breaking the fix-verify loop. Partial compatibility if user approves promptly.

**Known Issues**:
- Plan mode fundamentally conflicts with debugger's "fix immediately" constraint (DBG-004)
- Recommend: Use `/auto-orchestrate` (Phase 5e — debug sub-loop) which operates in auto-accept mode

### auditor

**Preferred Mode**: Any (fully compatible with all modes)
**Constraints**: AUD-001 (read-only) — auditor NEVER writes to project files

**Behavior by Mode**:
- **Plan Mode**: Full functionality — audit is entirely read-only (Glob/Grep/Read only)
- **Auto-Accept**: Full functionality
- **Manual Approval**: Full functionality — no write operations to approve

**Known Issues**: None. Note that if auto-audit enters the remediation phase (spawning orchestrator to fix gaps), that phase requires Auto-Accept for software-engineer subagents.

## Tool Availability by Permission Mode

| Tool | Plan Mode | Auto-Accept | Manual Approval | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Read | ✅ Always | ✅ Always | ✅ Always | No restrictions |
| Glob | ✅ Always | ✅ Always | ✅ Always | No restrictions |
| Grep | ✅ Always | ✅ Always | ✅ Always | No restrictions |
| Write | ⚠️ Review | ✅ Auto | ⚠️ Approval | Context-dependent |
| Edit | ⚠️ Review | ✅ Auto | ⚠️ Approval | Context-dependent |
| Bash | ⚠️ Review | ✅ Auto | ⚠️ Approval (destructive) | Safe commands may auto-execute |
| Task | ⚠️ Context | ⚠️ Context | ⚠️ Context | **GAP-CRIT-001**: Availability not guaranteed by mode |

**Critical Finding**: Task tool availability is NOT determined by permission mode alone. It depends on spawn mechanism and conversation context (see GAP-CRIT-001 in `claude-code/_shared/references/TOOL-AVAILABILITY.md`).

## Autonomous Operation Recommendations

### For `/auto-orchestrate` Command

**Recommended Setup**:
1. Use Auto-Accept mode (permission granted in Step 0a)
2. Grant session folder access (`.orchestrate/`, `~/.claude/sessions/` legacy fallback, `~/.claude/plans/`)
3. Accept "no clarifying questions" policy (command makes assumptions)

**Expected Behavior**:
- orchestrator spawned in Auto-Accept mode
- Subagents inherit Auto-Accept permissions
- No approval prompts during execution loop
- Full autonomous operation

**Known Limitation**: Task tool may still be unavailable (GAP-CRIT-001), but Write/Edit/Bash work without approval prompts.

### For Phase 5e (Debug sub-loop, formerly /auto-debug)

**Recommended Setup**:
1. Use Auto-Accept mode (requires Write/Edit/Bash for applying fixes)
2. Ensure Docker daemon access if debugging Docker services
3. Grant project directory write access (debugger applies targeted fixes)

**Expected Behavior**:
- debugger spawned in Auto-Accept mode by /auto-orchestrate when Phase 5e activates
- Applies minimal-blast-radius fixes to specific files
- Spawns researcher subagent for unfamiliar errors (WebSearch/WebFetch)
- Never commits or pushes — outputs suggested commit message only

**Known Limitation**: Task tool may still be unavailable (GAP-CRIT-001).

### For Phase 5v (Validation + Audit sub-loop, formerly /auto-audit)

**Recommended Setup**:
1. Auto-Accept mode is NOT required for the auditor portion — auditor is read-only (AUD-001)
2. Auto-Accept IS required for the remediation portion — software-engineer applies fix tasks

**Expected Behavior**:
- auditor runs in any permission mode (read-only) when /auto-orchestrate enters Phase 5v
- Produces `YYYY-MM-DD_audit-report.md` and `gap-report.json` (per cycle subdirectory)
- On gaps found: orchestrator re-enters Stage 3 in remediation mode
- compliance_threshold (default 90%) governs when loop exits

**Known Limitation**: Remediation phase inherits auto-orchestrate limitations (GAP-CRIT-001).

### For Manual Agent Invocation

**For software-engineer**:
```markdown
⚠️ Auto-Accept Required

The software-engineer agent operates under IMPL-002 (Don't ask — make decisions).
This conflicts with approval-based workflows.

**Action**: Grant auto-accept for this conversation or use `/auto-orchestrate`
```

**For technical-writer**:
- Manual approval OK for doc reviews
- Auto-accept preferred for batch doc updates

**For product-manager**:
- Any mode works
- Manual approval allows reviewing tasks before creation

## Fallback Behaviors

### When Task Tool Unavailable (All Modes)

orchestrator MUST NOT perform any work itself (MAIN-001, MAIN-002 are non-negotiable). Instead:
1. **Propose work via PROPOSED_ACTIONS** — auto-orchestrate reads proposals and delegates to the correct subagent on the next iteration
2. **Write task proposals** to `.orchestrate/<session-id>/proposed-tasks.json` for auto-orchestrate to process
3. **Report failure** — include in return value that Task tool was unavailable so auto-orchestrate can retry spawning
4. **Use Read/Glob/Grep for analysis only** — research and planning are allowed; writing, editing, or implementing code is NEVER allowed

See: `claude-code/_shared/references/TOOL-AVAILABILITY.md` (GAP-CRIT-001)

### When Write/Edit Unavailable (Plan/Manual Modes)

Agents that require Write/Edit will:
1. **Request approval** for each file operation
2. **Batch operations** when possible (single approval for multiple files)
3. **Escalate** if approval is denied

### When Bash Unavailable (Restricted Modes)

Skills that rely on Bash commands will:
1. **Use Read-only alternatives** (Grep instead of shell grep)
2. **Defer** to user for command execution
3. **Document** required commands for manual execution

## Testing Permission Mode Compatibility

### Test Checklist

To verify agent behavior across modes:

- [ ] **orchestrator**: Test in auto-accept with and without Task tool
- [ ] **software-engineer**: Verify failure in plan mode, success in auto-accept
- [ ] **technical-writer**: Test docs-write in all three modes
- [ ] **product-manager**: Test task creation in manual approval mode
- [ ] **session-manager**: Test boot sequence (Step 0) in manual mode

### Test Procedure

1. Create test session in each permission mode
2. Invoke agent with known task
3. Observe tool access patterns
4. Document approval prompts vs auto-execution
5. Check for degraded functionality vs complete failure

## Remediation Checklist
